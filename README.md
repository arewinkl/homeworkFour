# Homework Number 4

for this assignment we were asked to generate a quiz that would be able to test us on what our knowledge of coding is so far.

### The task is to create it with a timing element as well.
-to start this homework I took the time to not only comment out what I needed to do, but also write out __sudocode__ to help me get started.

-The timing element was hard to implement especially since we learned it just the other day, but now that I have added to this assignment, I can see many instances where a __timing element__ could be handy.

-The next challenge was to generate the questions dynamically, it is much easier to make elements appear on a page, but adding a dynamic function required the addition of arrays.

-The timing element and the dynamically generated questions needed to show up at the same time and work together.

### Problems that I encountered.

-This being the third week of class it truly does feel like we are being thrown directly into the frying pan and this assignment was an accurate representation of that. Its fun to see where the class is heading and how we are finally beginning to string multiple concepts that we have learned into one assignment.

-getting the final score to show up on the final page was challenging for me since my submit button on my html led to the end of the array and I really struggled finding a way to generate that final score consistently and then be able to save and store it.

-My scores were working well based on how many questions the person got right. But once I started adding the timing element, it all got messed up and isn't currently working. *(will go back and try to fix)*.

### What I learned

-This assignment gave me a great opportunity to practice making and using arrays. Being able to __create a single array__ to store all of the necessary information and data for the function to draw upon.

-realizing too that you can nest functions that work together inside each other made this project more manageable and easier to flip between screens and easily find what I was looking for.

-One thing that ive noticed with this project is that I have gotten much better at both my indenting and how I lay out my page that im working on. By placing all the variables at the top, and nesting functions that work together next to each other so they can be adjusted at the same time, if need be.

### Screenshots.

-below are four screenshots that I believe show the key elements of this project, and what I was able to build relies mainly on what is held in the screen shots below. There were a few functions that you can't see, but they were nestled within these main functions.
